            <h1>Diploma in Electrical Engineering</h1>
            <h3></h3>
            <h4> This Diploma Electrical Engineering course basically deals with the power used for lighting, heating, cooling, refrigeration and operating home appliances, control systems, electronics, and signal processing.
                The study and application of electricity, electromagnetism, and electronics to process information and transmit energy is known as electrical engineering.
                The Diploma in Electrical Engineering course mainly focuses on electrical elements and devices which are used to generate electricity from different methods such as Windmills, Nuclear power plants.
                In each semester the candidate will study the different subjects that teach analytical, technical and design skills. Electrical engineering enables students to comprehend the many applications of electricity and electronics.</h4>
                er in Electrical  Engineering can be a great opportunity in the future as the “Vision of For Electrical Equipment”  is expected to increase the net worth of the Electrical and Electronics Market to USD 100 Billion by 2022
Now-a-days most of the devices that are used are electricity-based and thus getting popular day by day because of it’s eco-friendly nature and that is why everything is now replaced by electricity such as electrical bikes and electrical cars hence it expands opportunities for the electrical engineers.
The Vision 2022 is expected to create 1.5 million direct employment for electrical engineers and 2 million indirect employment according to the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises.
Electronics have become a daily part of our life. This helps to gain knowledge in the power system and computer systems and the market for electronic goods is increasing day by day, hence there are good career scopes for electrical engineers
Advancements in technology, such as the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Industry 4.0, have expanded the opportunities even further.
The diploma in electrical engineering course offers a variety of specializations from which students can choose, thus allowing them to focus on their areas of interest in the study.
Students who have interest in studying engineering and its related field should take up the Diploma in Electrical Engineering course.
Candidates who want to pursue a career as an Instrumentation engineer can pursue the Diploma Engineering Course.
Students who wish to build upon their knowledge of different topics of mathematics and science such as generation, distribution, storage and conversion of electrical power/energy etc in higher secondary level should take up the course.
Candidates who have interest to pursue a career as an Industrial engineer can take up the course.
Students who have a career planned in Digital Computers, Computer Engineering, Control System, Radio-Frequency Engineering, Signal Processing, Power Engineering etc should take up the course.
Ethical and passionate students who have planned to start their own business in future should take up the diploma in electrical engineering course.
This course is also effective for candidates who wish to gain a certificate in electrical engineering in a comparative shorter period of time, and be job ready.
